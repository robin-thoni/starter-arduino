CMake Arduino starter kit
=========================

Here is starter kit for Arduino using CMake build system. The aim is be able to use CLion for Arduino development.

Usage
-----
Just clone and open the directory with CLion, it will generate a target to build and upload code to the arduino.

See CMakeLists.txt to configure on which device it should upload.

So, you just have to set your device and build (do not run, just build, it will do the trick).

Bonus
-----
A useful plugin to use with it is https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8031?pr=phpStorm

It will add a serial monitor window to CLion.
